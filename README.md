# Web_Final_Proyect

## What is this thing?
Untitled is a service used by people to
post what they are currently working and offer advice, help, or simply support other people. Users
can see other users goals and comment on them.
## Why?
This project will allow individuals/teams have an organized way
of keeping track of what they want to achieve.

## How does it work?
![Homescreen](/untitled_ss_home.png)
Once you register and log in you will be redirected to this section. In the toolbar you can see the following sections:
- Global : This section allow users to see public goals of the community, when you click on a goal you will be shown a thread of updates.
- Local: This section will show your own goals, including the goals of a team you are part of. 
- Teams: Show the teams you're part of. 
- Notifications: Every time a user comments on one of your goals you can decide if you allow that comment to be shown or not. Your own comments will be taken into consideration. Think of this as having second thoughts. A feature, not a bug.

## My user id / Team id
As you can see in the top section there is a text that says "My user id: XXXX", use this id so other users can add you to their team. Team also have ids, you can check your team's id in the Team section.
Also when you create a goal you will be asked a Team, add the id of your team to asign that goal to every member of the team.
